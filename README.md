Sleep Cycle Data Analysis

By Erin, Shannon, Jaida, & Jacob

This is an app that users are able to put in their own data (a csv file) from the Sleep Cycle App and into our site. 
It will then display a graph, of two sets of data, their sleep quality and how long they slept.

Some goals for this would to somehow save the user's data on the site/some server. 
Also, implementing buttons as to other effects of sleep, and giving you a general result of how well you're sleeping.

Lastly, if we're able to store the data, then maybe a way to compare other user's data and how you can improve?

A stretch goal would be to implement zoom functionality, and if it's possible to hover and see specific sorts of data without the use of d3.js.

Current resources used so far is the p5 tutorial on how to drag and drop a file.
